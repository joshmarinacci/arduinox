ArduinoX: IDE for Arduino
========

ArduinoX (pending a better name) is an alternative IDE for Arduino. It focuses on
having a better out of the box experience than the standard IDE. It is more
attractive, easier to use, and has better support for 3rd party boards.

ArduinoX is still very alpha, but it can edit, compile, and download to several
standard boards already.

Current features include:

* new code editor with line numbers, better color scheme, anti-aliasing, and a
better default font

* board chooser, port chooser, and serial console integrated into the editor 
window, making it easier to use multiple serial ports at once

* a sidebar for help and searching example code
